AI-Powered Nginx Log Analysis System
Hey! This project is all about making sense of those long, complicated Nginx logs using AI. Instead of manually scrolling through thousands of lines looking for errors or weird behavior, this system helps you automatically detect anomalies and generates easy-to-understand incident reports — so you can spend less time troubleshooting and more time fixing.

What This Does
Nginx Log Parsing: Reads and understands Nginx access and error logs smoothly.

Smart Anomaly Detection: Uses AI to spot unusual patterns or potential issues you might miss.

Auto Incident Reports: Creates clear reports based on detected problems, helping your team act faster.

Flexible: Built to be extended if you want to add more log types or detection features later.
